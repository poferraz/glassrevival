### 3. Fix SetList Height Calculation ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Ensure primary actions stay visible when keyboard opens  
**Status:** Starting implementation  
**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/SetList.tsx`
- `client/src/index.css`

**Technical Approach:**
- Use VisualViewport API for keyboard detection
- Replace fixed max-h-[48dvh] with calculated height
- Apply translateY to active set row only

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 7 regions visible without scroll in normal use
- [ ] Complete button always visible with keyboard open
- [ ] Timer bar remains accessible
- [ ] Smooth transitions, no layout thrash

### 4. Improve Accessibility ⏸️ PENDING
**Goal:** Ensure focus order follows visual order and proper ARIA labels  
**Status:** Waiting for Fix #3 completion  
**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/SetRow.tsx`
- `client/src/components/SetList.tsx`
- Modal components throughout

**Focus Management:**
- Standard accessible modal pattern
- Focus trap within modals
- Visible focus rings on glass components
- 44px minimum hit targets

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tab navigation follows visual order
- [ ] All controls have proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Hit targets minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Focus rings visible on glass components
- [ ] Screen reader announces updates

---

### 5. Add Basic Testing Framework ⏸️ PENDING
**Goal:** Establish Playwright testing for layout and interaction flows  
**Status:** Waiting for Fix #4 completion  
**Files to create:**
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `tests/` directory structure
- Package.json updates

**Test Coverage:**
- iPhone 16 Pro layout (393x852, DPR 3)
- 7-region workout mode order
- SetRow edit flow
- Modal interactions
- No-scroll requirement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Playwright configured with WebKit
- [ ] Custom iPhone 16 Pro device profile
- [ ] Layout tests verify 7-region order
- [ ] Edit flow tests pass
- [ ] npm run test command works

## Implementation Notes

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
# For Vite apps, environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat  # optional, has default

# Get your API key from: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
# Create a .env.local file in the project root with these variables
```

### Performance Targets
- Initial JS: <250KB gzipped
- Interactions: <100ms response
- Animations: 60fps, no layout thrash
- Network: 15s timeout with retry

### Error Handling Patterns
- CSV import: Inline result card with error table
- AI failures: Friendly inline error with retry
- Data corruption: Blocking banner with repair option
